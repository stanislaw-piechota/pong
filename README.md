# pong
This project works with python 3.7.3 and pygame 1.9.5.
From version 1.0 there is changed:
- restarting game after win
- compatibility with PEP8 document

I tried to fix some bugs:
-function 'collidepoint' isn't working properly
-there is no speed added
You can see it in some files, because there is some codes in comment blocks.

If you can help me fixing this I would be happy.
Thank you from the mountain! :)
